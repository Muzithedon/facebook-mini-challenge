/* If display has the value none,
user agents must ignore position and float. In this case,
the element generates no box. Otherwise,
position has the value absolute or fixed,
display is set to block and float is set to none. The position of the box will be determined by the top,
right,
bottom and left properties and the box's containing block.
 Otherwise,
if float has a value other than none,
display is set to block and the box is floated. Otherwise,
the remaining display properties apply as specified. */
